# Adaptive Quadtree Refinement and Matching Pursuit
CÃ³digo para Adaptive Quadtree Refinement and Matching Pursuit (AQMP)

# Things to Do:

- [x] Compare with JPEG Algorithm
- [ ] Print or show different compression levels
- [ ] Check alternative dictionaries
   - [ ] Adaptive dictionaries: DCT or wavelet bases, K-means clustering-based dictionary.
   - [ ] Non-orthogonal basis functions: Gabor wavelets or curvelets.
- [ ] Test different compression levels with sparsity parameter.
- [ ] Implement DEFLATE function from zlib to see check if there are changes in the SSIM index.
